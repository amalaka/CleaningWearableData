Cleaning Wearable Data
======================

ata Cleaning for wearable computing activities data
------------------------------------------

Using the data set for wearable computing activities data the analysis is carried out. The R script called 'run_analysis.R' does the following on the data set.
  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  
  5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 


The analysis includes the following files:
------------------------------------------

- 'README.md'

- 'run_analysis.R' : The R script mentioned above used to process data

- 'CodeBook.md': Code book for the processed (final) data set.

- 'final_data.txt': Processed data set written to text file.
